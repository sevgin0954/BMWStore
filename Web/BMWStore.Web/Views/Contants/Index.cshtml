            THE BMW STORE HISTORY
            Here at The BMW Store we've done a lot in 4 decades and are very proud of our past and looking forward to an
            incredible future.
        </div>

        <div class="mb-3">
            Our customers have taken us a long way but here's a little bit about how it all started!
        </div>

        <div class="mb-3">
            It was in 1979 that Tom Schwartz obtained his franchise from BMW. Prior to that, he had been deeply involved with
            BMWs as a technician. From 1971 - 1976, Tom ran an independent service repair business called The BMW Store.
            With those roots, his dealership has always placed a premium on customer service with the goal of assuring
            customers a hassle-free ownership experience.
        </div>

        <div class="mb-3">
            Today, nearly 125 employees at The BMW Store are dedicated to helping people discover the joys of driving a BMW.
        </div>

        <div class="mb-3">
            There's a highly trained, knowledgeable sales staff for both new and pre-owned BMWs, an inventory of over 100
            new and 90 pre-owned BMWs is maintained to provide excellent selection, and master technicians head service
            teams specialized in the various operating systems of BMWs.
        </div>

        <div class="mb-3">
            A recently expanded service bay features 28 lifts. More than three quarters of a million dollars in parts are
            kept on site for quick service, and there's a fleet of well maintained courtesy vehicles for your servicing
            convenience...not to mention our new state-of-the-art facility that opened in October 2016!
        </div>

        <div class="mb-3">
            Providing state-of-the-art support for BMW drivers is the natural culmination of The BMW Store's passion
            for the marque. And for thousands of BMW customers in the Tri-State area, it's one more reason why they
            choose to drive a BMW.
